PiggyBankers is a project for the 2019 Knight Hacks event at the University of Central Florida.


This android application was a challenge response to the Royal Bank of Canada.

The challenge was to come up with a creative solution that could potentially help people with their finances.

The app is barebones but it's intended purpose was to serve as a gamified version of a budgeting assistant. The intent was to have a user engaged in taking responsibility for their finances with achievements being used to draw the user in and possibly a social aspect to it. The app would have also allowed users to allocate money to certain "piggybanks" that would be assigned to any object or goal the user wanted. For example, the app would be able to give the user a piggy bank to help them save up money for a car. This would have also been used in conjunction with visual aids designed to show the user where their money was going.
